# The Wire Journal - AI-Powered Newsroom Platform

**The Wire Journal** is a sophisticated AI-powered automated newsroom that generates professional, publication-ready news articles across six specialized beats: Politics, Economics, World Affairs, Business, Technology, and Opinion.

## How It Works

### 1. **Intelligent Research & Writing**
